### 1. I have created the Maven project and build the library in java.
### 2. DataStore.java in the source consists of the all the CRD operations which internally uses Utility.java.
### 3. In the target folder there is a freshworks jar which can be imported in you desired project and it's usage can be found in UsageExample.java
### 4. I have written junit tests in the DataStoreTest.java file where I have verified all the CRD operations.
### 5. The default file location will work for Windows OS but in case of Mac please provide a proper location path to the constructor variable.
